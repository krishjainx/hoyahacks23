Preliminary prototype of retirement savings planner

*Inspiration*: 
Retirement planning is an important aspect of financial planning, but it can often be complicated and overwhelming for many people. Our team has developed an Android app that uses AI to make retirement planning easy and accessible for everyone.

*What it does*:
Simplifies the complex process of retirement planning Provides personalized recommendations based on the user's unique financial situation Helps users make informed decisions about their investments and social security benefits Allows users to easily track their progress and stay on track with their plan

*How we built it*:
Our team utilized Kotlin, a programming language that is widely used for building Android apps, to develop the user interface and overall functionality of the app. Kotlin offers a number of advantages over other programming languages, such as improved performance and a more concise syntax, which made it the ideal choice for our project.

We also used Python, a powerful programming language known for its flexibility and ease of use, to develop the machine learning (ML) algorithms that drive the personalized recommendations and investment suggestions within the app.
